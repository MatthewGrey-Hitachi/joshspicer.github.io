This is Josh Spicer <hello@joshspicer.com>.  I am confirming that:

My OLD pgp key created on March 8th 2018 with fingerprint 415A 4243 34C5 C83A BE00  04CA D5C4 AC84 C321 1123 is now REVOKED.

My NEW pgp key created on Nov 15th 2020 with fingerprint F5EB 0F7A B4DC 73D7 CF2A  2F07 4DFE 42EE 22D8 4A62 is now my ACTIVE key.

This is correct as of Nov 15th 2020.  I am signing this file two times with my OLD key and my NEW key as proof.
