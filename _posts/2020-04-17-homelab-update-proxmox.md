Over the past few days i've been upgrading my [homelab](/homelab) setup. The biggest change - ditching ESXi for open source, KVM hypervisor [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/)! I wanted to try something with better storage support (proxmox is debian-based and supports [ZFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) and more flexibility for my non-production environment.

Below are some of the "gotchas" I faced when getting Proxmox up and running!

## Remove Enterprise Apt Repository

Running an `apt update` will fail out-of-the-box, as by default Proxmox is set to pull from the Enterprise apt repos. See the [Proxmox wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package_Repositories) for more details. Here are the abbreviated steps on how to fix this:

You'll want to comment out the line in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list`.

Now add the following repo to `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

```
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve buster pve-no-subscription
```

## Adding Second NIC to Proxmox

_**tags:** proxmox new nic no internet, no flashing lights_

I recently added a new dual NIC to my existing proxmox machine. I found I wasn't able to connect to proxmox via my existing motherboard's network interface.

I saw that both the new (Intel x2) and old interface (Realtek) were all being detected.

```bash
root@proxmox:/# lspci
...
...
01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 06)
01:00.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82571EB Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 06)
02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 16)
```

```bash
root@proxmox:/# dmesg | grep eth | head -n 30
   3.512907 r8169 0000:02:00.0 eth0: RTL8168h/8111h, b4:2e:99:3c:a1:11, XID 541, IRQ 127
   3.512908 r8169 0000:02:00.0 eth0: jumbo features [frames: 9200 bytes, tx checksumming: ko]
   3.513604 r8169 0000:02:00.0 enp2s0: renamed from eth0
   3.663348 e1000e 0000:01:00.0 eth0: (PCI Express:2.5GT/s:Width x4) 00:15:17:6c:cc:55
   3.663349 e1000e 0000:01:00.0 eth0: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
   3.663430 e1000e 0000:01:00.0 eth0: MAC: 0, PHY: 4, PBA No: C57721-005
   3.827424 e1000e 0000:01:00.1 eth1: (PCI Express:2.5GT/s:Width x4) 00:15:17:6c:cc:56
   3.827425 e1000e 0000:01:00.1 eth1: Intel(R) PRO/1000 Network Connection
   3.827509 e1000e 0000:01:00.1 eth1: MAC: 0, PHY: 4, PBA No: C57721-005
   3.828068 e1000e 0000:01:00.0 enp1s0f0: renamed from eth0
   3.847163 e1000e 0000:01:00.1 enp1s0f1: renamed from eth1
```

You can see that my existing (Realtek) ethernet controller had been renamed to `enp2s0`, and my new network card had taken the "1" place. This renaming was the cause of my issue.

Looking at `/etc/network/interfaces`, I saw that I needed to fix the `bridge-ports` entry on `vmbr0` to my interface's new name.

Below shows a snippet of my corrected `interfaces` file - now bridging my `enp1s0f0` interface to the proxmox virtual interface.

```
iface enp2s0 inet manual
#MOBO RJ-45

iface enp1s0f0 inet manual
#RIGHT RJ-45

iface enp1s0f1 inet manual
#LEFT RJ-45

auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
	address 10.1.0.11/24
	gateway 10.1.0.1
	bridge-ports enp1s0f0
	bridge-stp off
	bridge-fd 0
#WAN
```

I then simply bring the interface up with `ifup enp2s0`.

## Encrypt ZFS dataset

I wanted a volume (ZFS called these "datasets") on my ZFS drives to be encrypted. Proxmox has some documention on [zfs encryption](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/ZFS_on_Linux#zfs_encryption) which I recommend reading first.

For context, i'd already created a MIRRORED zpool in Proxmox GUI with my two 2TB physical drives. The pool is called `bulk`.

```
root@proxmox:/# zpool status
  pool: bulk
 state: ONLINE
  scan: none requested
config:

	NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
	bulk        ONLINE       0     0     0
	  mirror-0  ONLINE       0     0     0
	    sdb     ONLINE       0     0     0
	    sdc     ONLINE       0     0     0
```

From your proxmox instance, instantiate a new zfs dataset and enable encryption.

```bash
root@proxmox:/# zfs create -o encryption=on -o keyformat=passphrase keylocation=prompt bulk/secure
```

Let Proxmox VE know about this new dataset.

```bash
root@proxmox:/# pvesm add zfspool bulk-secure -pool bulk/secure
```

You can check your work like so. All child datasets from `bulk/secure` should also inherit these settings.

```
root@proxmox:/# zfs get encryption bulk
NAME  PROPERTY    VALUE        SOURCE
bulk  encryption  off          default
root@proxmox:/# zfs get encryption bulk/secure
NAME         PROPERTY    VALUE        SOURCE
bulk/secure  encryption  aes-256-ccm  -
```

```
root@proxmox:/bulk/secure# zfs list
NAME          USED  AVAIL     REFER  MOUNTPOINT
bulk         1.15M  1.76T       96K  /bulk
bulk/secure   196K  1.76T      196K  /bulk/secure
```

### Mounting Volume

```
zfs load-key -a
# Enter password

zfs mount bulk/secure
```

## Pulling linux container

Proxmox has native support for LXC (Linux Containers).

In a Proxmox shell, check what containers are preloaded with `pveam available`.

```bash
root@proxmox:/mnt# pveam available | grep ubuntu
system          ubuntu-16.04-standard_16.04.5-1_amd64.tar.gz
system          ubuntu-18.04-standard_18.04.1-1_amd64.tar.gz
system          ubuntu-19.04-standard_19.04-1_amd64.tar.gz
system          ubuntu-19.10-standard_19.10-1_amd64.tar.gz
```

Before using a container, you'll need to download it.

`pveam download local ubuntu-19.10-standard_19.10-1_amd64.tar.gz`

Your container should now be availble in the Proxmox GUI!

### Locale issues in debian-based LXC container

I sometimes see locale errors a lot in fresh debian LXC containers (esp. when running `apt`).  I've found reinstalling locales and configuring it with your own locale (`en-US` for me).

```
apt install --reinstall --purge locales
dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

## Enter a Linux Container from Proxmox SSH

Quick one! This is the equivalent of `docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash`.

```bash
root@proxmox:/# pct enter 102

root@storage:/#
```

You can get the container ID either from the proxmox web GUI, or from `pct list`.


## Setting Up Time Machine Backups

Lots of guides online seem outdated on enabling time machine on linux. Since [Samba 4.8](https://github.com/samba-team/samba/pull/64) we've been able to advertise sambda shares as time capsules - and it's very easy!

#### Proxmox GUI Setup

- Create an Ubuntu container.
- Mount a ZFS share from Proxmox GUI to any mountpoint (`/timemachine`).

#### Container Setup

- Create user with no shell `useradd tmachine --shell /bin/false`
- Change owner of mounted drive `chown tmachine: /timemachine`
- Install dependencies `apt install samba avahi-daemon`

#### Samba Setup

In `/etc/samba/smb.conf` :

```
[timemachine]
    comment = Time Machine
    path = /timemachine
    browseable = yes
    writeable = yes
    create mask = 0600
    directory mask = 0700
    spotlight = yes
    vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr
    fruit:aapl = yes
    fruit:time machine = yes
    valid users=tmachine
```
- Set a password for our user with `smbpasswd -a tmachine`

- Restart samba `sudo systemctl restart smbd`

- Allow [Samba ports](https://www.samba.org/~tpot/articles/firewall.html) through relevant firewalls

All set! You should now see your share in time machine when on the same local network.
