Join me this year as I participate in my frist [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) monthly long coding challenge!

I'll be sharing my solutions on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshspicer/adventofcode2020) as I complete them.  I've started the challenge solving the solutions in `Swift`, with the idea that i'll be rotating languages throughout (been meaning to try some `F#`).
